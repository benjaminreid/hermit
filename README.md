# :crab: Hermit

Hermit is a simple and lightweight starting point for single page static websites.

It provides a fast and pain-free developer experience with live reloading from [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) and utility-first CSS support from [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) so you can iterate quickly and ship as little code as possible to your visitors.

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) handles the processing of the CSS so you can easily extend it as you might need and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) is good to go when you need to build your site.
